## Main Purpose

The initial purpose is to develop

* a convenient libray to help manage the complex process of data reduction and analysis 

* a better tool for visual inspection

for JWST/NIRCam WFSS and Image data.

Maybe in the future I will extend it to include NIRSpec and IFU. (1)
{ .annotate }

1.  :smile_cat: If I have time.

## Who may want to use it :thinking:

Of course everybody is welcome to use this project 🎉.

But if may want to try this project, if:

1. You are freshman of observational astronomy and not familiar with python. Then here is a noob friend (noob modifies friend, i.e., I am not an expert) for you. :nerd:

2. You want to paly with WFSS data, but get tired of reading mountains of documents.

??? note "3rd reason"
    You cannot tolerate running program with python<3.9! :angry:

## How to start

If you are busy, just go through the key concept.

Or you can read the step-by-step tutorial, which will provide a process that begins from 0.5. (1) 
{ .annotate }

1.  It will try to be beginner-friendly, but I still assume you have some common sense of computer, such as how to search on the website, how to open the terminal, etc. :cry:
