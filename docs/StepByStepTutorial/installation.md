# How to install it

First, open an terminal window and start your shell, I am using [fish](https://fishshell.com/). (1) 
{ .annotate }

1.  **Fish** 🐟 is a morden shell with smooth experience of auto completion, highly recommend you to have a try 😉！

=== "uv"
    ```shell title="fish"
    uv add jwstnoobfriend
    ```
=== "pip"
    ```shell title="fish"
    pip install jwstnoobfriend
    ```

???+ note "use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management"
    Wait🤔, what is **uv** here? You may have this question.
